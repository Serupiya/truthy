Truth tables have always been tedious and strenuous to create by hand; it's easy
for your mind to lose track and for your hand to fatigue. Truthy is a web app
designed to reduce this manual labor by automatically generating the truth
tables for any boolean expressions you supply.

You can view the app online at:
